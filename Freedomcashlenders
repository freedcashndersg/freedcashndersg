State lawmakers who want a well-functioning market for small loans will need to establish strong but flexible safeguards to protect consumers and ensure transparency. Legislators in states where payday loan stores operate should consider measures similar to Ohioâ€™s Fairness in Lending Act Freedomcashlenders, which was passed in July. The law tackles the main problems in the market by lowering prices, requiring that payments be affordable, and giving borrowers reasonable time to repay. It also includes crucial provisions to balance the interests of consumers and lenders, thereby ensuring widespread access to credit.
